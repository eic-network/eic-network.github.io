    <p class="lead">Our primary purpose is the joint reporting and publication of investigative journalism
        with a focus on European topics to understand how power structures affect European communities.</p>
    <h4>Cooperation</h4>
    <p>The basis for cooperation among EIC member organizations is the regular sharing of information and
        consultations on possible story ideas. We have regular meetings and work on several fronts: tackling
        European stories; finding, compiling, processing or analyzing big data-sets; developing under Free
        Software license our own Network collaborative tools, platforms und information design.</p>
    <p>We take a long-term approach and therefore involve in our collaborative projects the generation #25
        to work together with senior reporters and editors.</p>
    <h4>Membership</h4>
    <p>This is a non-exclusive Network, meaning that members can be part of other Networks, but only one
        medium or media outlet from each European country can be an EIC member, ensuring national
        exclusivity.</p>
    <h4>Coordination</h4>
    <p>Stefan Candea is coordinating the Network communication, workflow and tools development. Each
        investigative collaboration will have him working closely with the story initiator to decide on the
        work plan, tools and publication schedule.</p>

    <p class="lead">Here are our governing principles:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>In a healthy network all nodes (participants) should profit from the network;</li>
        <li>Keep the network alive, open to fresh ideas and people following new suggestions on
            partnerships;
        </li>
        <li>In order to achieve a healthy growth, better network density and kick-starting the whole
            process, we will act as a laboratory for networked (investigative) journalism;
        </li>
        <li>We start with basic research projects that would also be used to establish networking
            tools and collaborative platforms;
        </li>
        <li>Decentralize the network's decision making process on new stories, new partners, new
            projects;
        </li>
        <li>Understand and follow a set of predefined routines for each new project.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We believe networks are here to stay. Due to their structure and methodology, collaborative networks
        are one of the few mechanisms able to keep up with the globalized power structures (ie. governments,
        corporations), thus becoming the only way forward for investigative journalism. </p>
    <p>EIC is putting together different mind-sets, organization types and skills. This is insuring a flow
        of new challenges, ideas and approaches. Our aim is to build a European network to focus on
        independent, high-quality cross-border and European investigative journalism projects.</p>
    <p>Our focus areas: (un)organized crime, environment, sport, public spending, corporate corruption,
        lobby, public health, religious groups, state aid, military & secret services, banks & finance,
        labor markets, migration.</p>
