title: Malta Files
intro: The Malta Files show how the Mediterranean state works as a pirate base for tax avoidance
  inside the EU. Although profiting from the advantages of EU membership, Malta also welcomes large companies and wealthy
  private clients who try to dodge taxes in their home countries.
description: Over the last three months, EIC.network
  has dug into hundreds of thousands of documents that show how Malta operates a tax system where companies pay the lowest
  tax on profits in the EU.<br><br>This damages the budgets of other EU-countries and reveals a weakness in the European Union, which allows member states sovereign rights over their taxation.
