intro: null
description: In 2016, European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) started publishing
  in-depth reportage focused on events critical to Europe. The network currently includes
  more than 100 journalists, information-designers and technologists working together
  on specific large-scale projects. Due to our many meetings and conversations, small
  groups of journalists in our network discuss ideas for cross-border stories and
  publish articles that enlist the talents of the reporters from our pool of professionals.
  Links to such stories are listed below.
